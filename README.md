# FxServer-Update-log
A webhook based fxserver log with download link!

# DISCLAMER
I do not add my name to the person how runs this!
Due to web scraping can be illegal with sites (not sure if cfx.re is not allowing it or not)
Run this at your own risks! (If you change the loops wait that can be ddos so i would not advise that cuz you can be blacklisted on cloudflare and you dont want to write a big email to them about this!)

# You will need:
- Node.Js <br />
# Running the bot! (aka webhook)
Change the webhook in the bot.js and run the but with the provided commands! <br />
``` npm i ``` <br />
```node bot.js``` <br />
<br />
**OR** <br />
<br />
run the start.bat if you can't write 2 simple line!
