# FxServer-Update-log
A webhook based fxserver log with download link!

# DISCLAMER
I will not associate my name with those who misuse this web scraper, as it can be illegal in many places! I am not a legal professional or lawyer <br />
This was just a fun side project. <br />
Anyone who misuses it does so at their own risk! <br />
Due to web scraping can be illegal with sites (not sure if cfx.re is not allowing it or not) <br />
Run this at your own risks! (If you change the loops wait that can be ddos so i would not advise that cuz you can be blacklisted on cloudflare and you dont want to write a big email to them about this!)

# You will need:
- Node.Js <br />
# Running the bot! (aka webhook)
Change the webhook in the bot.js and run the but with the provided commands! <br />
``` npm i ``` <br />
```node bot.js``` <br />
<br />
**OR** <br />
<br />
run the start.bat if you can't write 2 simple line!
